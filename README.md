hk-hackathon-15-yesodweb
----------

This is the prototype I worked for a hackathon in HK during Oct.2 ~ Oct.4, 2015.

It is based on [Yesod](http://yesodweb.com) web framework, in Haskell.

It illustrated a basic website involving auth system, file uploading, MySQL db usage, server-side API data fetching & feeding.

It is based on a cloud service including VM instance, DB server and object storage service.

Besides, it depends on [aliyun-haskell-sdk](https://github.com/izgzhen/aliyun-haskell-sdk) work with [Aliyun cloud platform](http://www.aliyun.com).

Beside the cloud platform, some other API services it used are:

* Hacker News
* Coursera
* GitHub
* Meetup.com
